To build this project, add the DemoSobelFrameHw function as a Hardware function.
Set the Clock frequency for the function to 116.67MHz and the Data Motion Network
clock frequency to 116.67MHz. You can then build the project.

To use the project connect a video source to the HDMI I/O connector of the ZYBO,
a monitor to the VGA connector, and your computer to the USB PROG/UART connector.
Run the project on the ZYBO, and then connect to the ZYBO's COM port in a Terminal
program at Baud 115200. Further instructions are provided on the terminal.

*Note - Output on the VGA monitor will be cropped or padded if the output resolution
		does not match the HDMI input resolution.
